# SolidarityShield üõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

SolidarityShield is a decentralized, community-driven mutual insurance platform built on the Stacks blockchain. By leveraging smart contracts and oracle technology, we provide a transparent, fair, and collaborative approach to insurance.

### Key Principles

- **Community-Powered**: Members collectively manage and govern the insurance pool
- **Transparent**: All transactions and claims are recorded on-chain
- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls claim approvals
